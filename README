flac-utils is a toolkit for managing flac-files. It iconsists of two
parts; a python library built on mutagen and a set of tools using the
library.

Installation
============

TBD!

For now just go to your checked out copy's tools directory and run the
tools from there.


Tools
=====

flac-diff
---------
flac-diff [-h] [-v] OLDFILE NEWFILE

Compares two flac files.

positional arguments:
  OLDFILE        Flac file used as base line.
  NEWFILE        Second flac file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Verbose output.

flac-diff takes two flac files as argument and tells if they differ. Oposite
to normal diff flac-diff is flac aware. This means it compare the two tracks
md5 signatures to tell if the music is the same or not. Thereafter compares it
the tags/comments on the tracks and tells which differs. I.e you can have to
files with the same track but with different tags. flac-diff will tell you
which tags differ between the two files.
