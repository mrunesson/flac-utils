flac-utils is a toolkit for managing flac-files. It iconsists of two
parts; a python library built on mutagen and a set of tools using the
library.

Installation
============

TBD!

For now just go to your checked out copy's tools directory and run the
tools from there.


Tools
=====

flac-diff
---------
flac-diff [-h] [-v] OLDFILE NEWFILE

Compares two flac files.

positional arguments:
  OLDFILE        Flac file used as base line.
  NEWFILE        Second flac file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Verbose output.

flac-diff takes two flac files as argument and tells if they differ. Oposite
to normal diff flac-diff is flac aware. This means it compare the two tracks
md5 signatures to tell if the music is the same or not. Thereafter compares it
the tags/comments on the tracks and tells which differs. I.e you can have to
files with the same track but with different tags. flac-diff will tell you
which tags differ between the two files.


flac-merge
----------
flac-merge [-h] [-v] [-b] FILE FILE [DESTFILE]

Merge tags from two flac files.

positional arguments:
  FILE           Flac file used as base line.
  DESTFILE       Destination file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Verbose output.
  -b, --both     Save all tags to all files. If destination file given, all
                 three files will get the same tags.

flac-merge take two flac files and merge the tags. It requires that the md5
signature of the audio part in the files are equal. Values of the second file
will override the first file. If destination file not provided, result is
written to the second file.
