Tools
=====

flac-diff
---------
flac-diff OLDFILE NEWFILE

flac-diff takes two files as argument and tells if they differs. As a
difference to normal diff this tool is flac aware. This means it
compare the two tracks md5 signatures to tell if the music is the
same. Thereafter compares it the tags/comments on the tracks and tells
which differs. I.e you can have to files with the same track but with
different tags. flac-diff will tell you which tags differ between the
files.
